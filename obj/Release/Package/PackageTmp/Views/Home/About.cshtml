            Hi, we are KuizIt! We are on a mission to make learning awesome and unlock the deepest potential of each and every learner by making learning fun and engaging. Our game-based learning platform makes it easy to create, share and play learning games or trivia quizzes in minutes.
        </p><hr />
        <p class="text-justify color w-75 m-auto">
            We want to improve education all over the world and help everyone – of any age, aptitude or circumstance – unleash the magic of learning.
        </p>







        <p class="text-justify color w-50 m-auto">
            <br />
            Instead of looking down into their textbooks or devices, learners are encouraged to look up while playing and connect with each other – we call it a ‘campfire moment’. For us, engagement is about unlocking everyone’s potential. It means bringing that student from the back of the class to the front and letting everyone become the classroom superhero.
        </p>



        <p class="text-justify color w-50 m-auto">
            <br />
            Our vision is to build the leading learning platform in the world.
